Radial or pie menus have been around for a long time, but with a slightly challenging barrier to their implementation in web-applications they haven't seen that much use.  We proposed them as a way to navigate across graph-like data (similar ideas were implemented simultaneously in [Noctua](http://noctua.berkeleybop.org/)) with TaxonWorks.  They turned out to be very effective and when dynamically generated based on the content being annotated and a very effective way of improving our interfaces.
