This is work done by industrial design graduate student Lai Jiang. Given next to no background information Lai was tasked with interpretting what taxonomists do when they describe the Earth's biodiversity. Our goal in this assignment was to not bias her to thinking about the processes taxonomists use, but to rather learn from her design perspective. Her presentation included some really wonderful metaphors.
