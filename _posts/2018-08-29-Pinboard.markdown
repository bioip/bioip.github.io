One of the early concepts we followed up on was the "Pinboard", essentially a favourites slide-out with some built in functionality. We developed the pinboard in TaxonWorks and it has become a critical user-interface element that lets the user bridge interfaces via prioritizing and defaulting specific data.

* [Initial pinboard concept](https://invis.io/XFNRM5B5K2H#/155723641_Pinboard)

As ultimately implemented in TaxonWorks. Note that you can:
* Set a record as default (green arrow, presents option to auto-fill forms that can use that data)
* Pull up the radial annotator and annotate the object (record) directly from the pinboard (blue icon)
* Jump to that record.
