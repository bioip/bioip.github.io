This is work done by industrial design graduate student Lai Jiang. Given very minimal information she was tasked to explored interfaces that would let us describe species via individual phenotypes.  She did a fantastic job of linking ideas from on-line card games to interfaces that let you define and organize what could be used as anatomy ontology descriptions.

* TODO An interactive prototype written in XXXX. And requires the XXX player, (Mac's only, sorry).
* TODO A narrated video created during development?
