One of the goals of our grant was to document how to implement prototypes.  To encourage others to join in the development the Install_TaxonWorks project documents how developers can (relatively) quickly get up and started with the software. This project demonstrates how to use docker, virtual machines, or native code bases to facilitate software development.
