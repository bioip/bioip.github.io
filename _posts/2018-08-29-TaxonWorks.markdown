The core of our proposal was innovation based, for example gathering user requirements and building out wireframes that documented workflows and potential user interface. We leveraged the evolving TaxonWorks codebase to implement a select few of our prototypes, some of which were refined until they reached production readiness.  For example these included the [radial annotator](/interfaces/semantics/2018/08/28/Radial-annotators.html), nomenclatural editing interfaces, and [pinboard](/interfaces/2018/08/28/Pinboard.html).

[TaxonWorks](http://taxonworks.org/) is a workbench whose development is lead by the Species File Group, the parent organization of PI Yoder.
