[In Vision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) is a web-app the help prototype and design user interfaces.  We adopted it early on and found it very useful for commenting and evolving wireframes, sharing series of them, and even live annotating them.  We found, however, that as we moved to implementing the interfaces it was easier to screenshot, annotate directly on the screenshot, and share our comments on live chats (Gitter channels).
