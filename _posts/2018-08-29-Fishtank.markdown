We (Matt, István, the former's logistics supported by this grant) participated in the 2017 Phenoscape KB-DataFest. Matt built a tool for visualizing phenotype data, István worked semantic modelling and how we might use Noctua.  We also explored representing phenotype data in NeXML, NeXSON, and other JSON based formats.
