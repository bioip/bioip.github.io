For several months several collaborators met informally on weekly basis, to discuss insect anatomy ontologies.  These informal meetings culminated in a grant sponsored workshop.  That workshop initiated several new ontologies, and saw some federation of past efforts to the umbrella of a "Insect Morphology" organization in Github.  Anatomy ontology content is being created and updated in 'mx', a prior project of Yoder's.
