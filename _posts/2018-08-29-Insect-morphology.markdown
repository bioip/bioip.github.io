In our last year, for several months, several collaborators met virtually for informal conversation on weekly basis, to discuss insect anatomy ontologies.  These informal meetings culminated in a grant sponsored workshop that wrapped up the project. That workshop initiated several new anatomy ontologies, pushed several slower moving ontologies along (with some significant conceptual advancements in particular for an insect level ontology), and saw some federation of past efforts to the umbrella of a "Insect Morphology" organization in Github. Anatomy ontology content is being created and updated in 'mx', a prior project of Yoder's.
