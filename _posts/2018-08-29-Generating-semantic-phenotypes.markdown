At about mid-point of our project PI Mikó documented our existing approach to creating semantic phenotypes for species descriptions. This included the workflow of how he linked data management in 'mx' to Protégé. From a technical and CSCW (Computer Supported Co-operative Work) perspective this is important reference, illustrating the complexity involved in producing semantic data linked to a biological domain. From a workflow and interface design perspective there is a *lot* of considerations to take into account in order to improve this process. We still have a long way to go to improve this workflow, and the underlying interfaces. Mikó's [publications](/categories) throughout this project are nice illustrations of how conceptual modelling advanced.
