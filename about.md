As we wrapped up the official duration of a recent NSF grant we needed a place to index and store the various bits and pieces of software and plans that were in various stages of completion.

This is an experimental (innovative?) use of a commonly used blog generator software to index the products from an NSF grant, in this case _ABI-1356515: "Collaborative Research: ABI Innovation: Rapid prototyping of semantic enhancements to biodiversity informatics platforms"_.   

# How does it work?  

Each post is links to a product, outcome, or observation dervied in whole or in part from the grant. 

# Why this format?

Grants like those in the ABI Innovation program are never truly done, or there are some pieces that are complete, and some that are not.  A challenge is to index the state of the grant, for reporting and other purposes (like archiving), making the bits and pieces available for future use.  Some bits are big (large presentations or graphics) and don't naturally fit in finalized archives like JOSS. Interfaces, and ideas for interfaces evolve over time, they may exist as [issue tracker issues](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/issues) or [InVision ](). There are several other goals at work:

* [git]( ) and github let's us collaboratively edit the posts, and let's others pull down the "results" by cloning the repository
* git based projects are readily hosted on major public platforms
* Existing software lets you produce websites that git hosting platforms will automatically turn into websites (like this one) 

# Issues

* Ideally reporting would blog out individual grant accomplishments as they were made public. _This, being an experiment conceived near the end of the grant, does not represent the ideal case_, in our case the dates on the blog posts don't correspond to the dates the products went live.
* Very large files still don't play super nice with public git repositories.
* Summarizing results has to happen in two places, NSF reporting and the blog. Ideally posts here could be batch processed for the format that fastlane lets you batch load.
